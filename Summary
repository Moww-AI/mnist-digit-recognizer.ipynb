ðŸš€ Project Overview
This is a basic image classification project using the MNIST dataset, which contains 70,000 grayscale images of handwritten digits (0â€“9). The goal is to train a neural network to recognize and classify these digits accurately.

ðŸ§± Step-by-Step Breakdown
1. Importing Libraries
python
Copy
Edit
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras import layers, models
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
We import TensorFlow for building the neural network, and Matplotlib for visualizing training results.

2. Loading the Dataset
python
Copy
Edit
(X_train, y_train), (X_test, y_test) = tf.keras.datasets.mnist.load_data()
We load the MNIST dataset, which is already available in TensorFlow. Itâ€™s split into training and test sets.

X_train, X_test: The images (28x28 pixels).

y_train, y_test: The corresponding labels (digits 0 to 9).

3. Preprocessing the Data
python
Copy
Edit
X_train, X_test = X_train / 255.0, X_test / 255.0
We normalize the pixel values to the range [0, 1] to help the model train faster and more effectively.

4. Building the Neural Network
python
Copy
Edit
model = models.Sequential([
    layers.Flatten(input_shape=(28, 28)),       # Convert 2D image to 1D vector
    layers.Dense(128, activation='relu'),       # Fully connected hidden layer
    layers.Dropout(0.2),                         # Dropout for regularization
    layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')      # Output layer for 10 classes
])
Flatten: Converts each 28x28 image into a 784-element vector.

Dense (128 neurons): A hidden layer with ReLU activation.

Dropout (20%): Helps prevent overfitting.

Dense (10 neurons): The output layer with softmax to output probabilities for the 10 classes.

5. Compiling the Model
python
Copy
Edit
model.compile(optimizer='adam',
              loss='sparse_categorical_crossentropy',
              metrics=['accuracy'])
Adam: An efficient optimizer for training.

Sparse Categorical Crossentropy: Used because labels are integers (not one-hot).

Accuracy: We want to track how well the model is doing.

6. Training the Model
python
Copy
Edit
history = model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=5, validation_data=(X_test, y_test))
We train the model for 5 epochs, using part of the data to validate performance.

7. Evaluating the Model
python
Copy
Edit
test_loss, test_acc = model.evaluate(X_test, y_test)
print('\nTest accuracy:', test_acc)
After training, we evaluate how well the model performs on unseen test data.

8. Visualizing Training Performance
python
Copy
Edit
plt.plot(history.history['accuracy'], label='Train Acc')
plt.plot(history.history['val_accuracy'], label='Val Acc')
We plot how accuracy improves over epochs for both training and validation data.

ðŸ§  In Summary
This project shows how a simple deep learning model can recognize handwritten digits with high accuracy using TensorFlow and Keras. Itâ€™s a great beginner project to understand the fundamentals of neural networks, model evaluation, and visualization.
